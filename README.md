UART design has programmable features for Transmission and  Reception of data bits.

UART (universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter) is a serial communication protocol. Basically this protocol is used to permit short distance, low cost and reliable full duplex communication. It is used to exchange data between the processor and peripherals. For reliable data transmission, serial communication is more effective than parallel communication when considering the cost as well as complexity of the system increases. To design a UART which is implemented with Verilog HDL can be easily integrated onto FPGA to achieve more reliable and error free data transmission.
